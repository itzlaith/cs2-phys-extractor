# CS2 Physics Data Extractor

Extract physics collision data from Counter-Strike 2 maps (both official and workshop maps).

## What it does

This tool finds your CS2 maps and extracts their physics collision meshes in multiple formats from world_physics.vmdl_c files. Choose between `.tri` (triangle mesh), `.vphys` (physics data), or both formats. Useful for Visibility checks on external cheats.

## Requirements

- Windows PC
- Steam with Counter-Strike 2 installed
- .NET Framework/.NET Core

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package ValveResourceFormat
   dotnet add package SteamDatabase.ValvePak
   ```
3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the program
2. Choose what to process:
   - All maps (official + workshop)
   - Only official maps  
   - Only workshop maps
3. Choose output format:
   - `.tri` files (triangle mesh data)
   - `.vphys` files (physics collision data)
   - Both formats
4. Physics data saves to output folder as `{mapname}.tri` and/or `{mapname}.vphys`

## How it works

- Automatically finds your Steam installation
- Scans CS2 map files (`.vpk` format)
- Extracts physics collision meshes from `world_physics.vmdl_c` files
- Saves collision data in your chosen format(s)

## Output Formats

- **`.tri`** - Triangle mesh format with vertex coordinates
- **`.vphys`** - Physics collision data in text format
- Choose one or both formats during extraction
